## Try out Pathfinder

There are two primary ways to go about trying this project out: either through cloning the project or downloading one of the releases for this project.

Once either of those are done, if you decide to run the source code itself, and not the ``.exe`` or ``.dmg`` from the releases, simply follow the following steps to get started.

### Running the Source Code

```
git clone https://github.com/isobarbaric/Pathfinder.git
cd Pathfinder
python main.py
```

### Getting an Executable File to Run Directly

For a hassle-free start with the executable, bypassing the need to interact with source code, navigate to [the releases section (https://github.com/isobarbaric/Pathfinder/releases/tag/Pathfinder) of this repository. Choose and download the appropriate file for your operating system - .exe for Windows or .dmg for Mac users. Once downloaded, a simple click on the file will directly launch the project!
