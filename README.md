## Try out Pathfinder

There are two primary ways to go about trying this project out: either through cloning the project or downloading one of the releases for this project.

Once either of those are done, if you decide to run the source code itself, and not the ``.exe`` or ``.dmg`` from the releases, simply follow the following steps to get started.

### Running the Source Code

```
git clone https://github.com/isobarbaric/Pathfinder.git
cd Pathfinder
python main.py
```

### Getting an Executable File to Run Directly

To get an executable to run directly without having to deal with source code, visit the releases section (LINK) on this repository and there, according to the operating system you are using, the corresponding file can be downloaded - either .exe for Windows or .dmg for Mac users. After downloading either of these, simply clicking on them will run the project directly!
