# Pathfinder

Thank you for checking out this project!

To try using this project, there are two primary ways this can be done: either through cloning the project or downloading one of the releases for this project.

Once either of those are done, if you decide to run the source code itself, and not the ``.exe`` or ``.dmg`` from the releases, simply follow the following steps to get started:


## Getting Started 

There are two primary ways to go about trying this project out. Either the source code can be run or one of the executable files can be downloaded and run directly from the releases

### Running the Source Code

To do this on Linux or Mac:
```
git clone https://github.com/isobarbaric/Pathfinder.git
cd Pathfinder
python3 main.py
```

To do this on Windows:
```
git clone https://github.com/isobarbaric/Pathfinder.git
cd Pathfinder
python main.py
```

### Getting an Executable File to Run Directly

To get an executable to run directly without having to deal with source code, visit the releases section (LINK) on this repository and there, according to the operating system you are using, the corresponding file can be downloaded - either .exe for Windows or .dmg for Mac users. After downloading either of these, simply clicking on them will run the project directly!
